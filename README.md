Dependencies
------------

This site was written in Python using Django. Both Django-South, Django-Celery, and [Django Analytical][6] are being used. It makes use of [Twitter Bootstrap][1] for CSS. The Javascript library [JQuery][2] is also being used. It provides the alert mechanism that is used by the site. The datetime widgets are provided by a [JQuery plugin][3]. Icons have been adapted from a [set of icons][4] originally developed for use for the iPhone. Social integration comes from [django-open-auth][6] and all dependencies of that application are dependencies of this one.The color scheme of the site has been adapted from [haveabet][5].
